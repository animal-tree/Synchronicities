## Summary to friend

Life update is that I’m lonely. Theres nothing about me to want or like. I think all the mysticism I witnessed and documented is the cause of the spirits of people, forming power structures that are just as greedy and corrupt as the human ones, except with the additional power to regulate peoples consciousness and perhaps even control over physics to some extent. I think our collective consciousness spirits pretty much parallel our collective human societies and problems. I also think most of my life, but especially in the last 6 years, I’ve been obstructed by those forces. After all, I finished my ChatGPT paper 5 years ago in the hospital, barely functioning to run the last successful experiment. I don’t think the obstructions are because they knew I could’ve stolen ChatGPT early before it was made by the people who are worthy, or because they knew I could come to other research advances sooner that would potentially give me power or influence… but because I might have. And that’s enough to enforce preventative measures. It’s not because I was gaurenteed to be a threat, but I might’ve been enough of one and it presumably costs nothing to destroy a person’s life through deceptive mystical interventions. I’ve seen too many such woven interventions to question that something straight out of a schizophrenic’s delusions has connived for a long time to convince me to act on trust and faith in metaphysics rather than in my own direct best capitalist interests

Whatever exists in the world is bad. It’s the same as human governments and corporate powers. It’s not God. But it exists, has directly and deceptively intervened in my life, and I have too much evidence for that 

Anyway, most people would go into schizophrenia from this understanding. I’m desensitized to it. But this understanding is isolating because it’s about beyond what human civilization has even reached / needs to know about 

Unlike Star Trek where civilization has already solved all of its problems and is justified to spread its solutions to alien civilizations beyond where man has gone before, human society hasn’t even solved its own corruptions and deceptions. There’s no point talking about how corrupt some distant alien frontier of space is when there are extremely evident corruptions still on earth 

But that obstruction and the loss and the loneliness together create a miserable life. I want to be wanted. When I’m not wanted — and without hair / with severely trauma-damaged personality I haven’t been — I feel no motivation to do anything. And with the demoralizing reality of “schizophrenics are most right about the world than the most-right religions” and “these things can and will personality target me if I start to actualize anything too threatening” and “arguing this is possible but it’s impossible to prove” combined with “I don’t really have trust/faith in humanity” and “I’m alone”, what reason is there to do anything? For who? Why? To what disappointing exhausting goal? I have no hair and the world will literally connive to keep me powerless, I have a consciousness that is useless in social and romantic situations, and memories of years of extreme discipline to discredit the actual benefit of trying

And on the schizophrenic view that these things mind-control and so on, they do. Every cliche thing a schizophrenic has tried to express through an unconvincing set of language symbols, is in some form true

Meanwhile clinicians are telling them they’re sick unable to see the justified terror in their eyes

Summary:

- collective consciousness is analogous to human collective power structures
- but it regulates mind
- schizophrenics are mostly right
- I’m demoralized by memories of obstructed successes, wasted disciplines, suspiciously sabotaging mental states, false hopes, exploited faith/trust, and people and things that have been ripped away from me

It’s made more credible by the actual forecasting of each major innovation combined with intense obstructive mental states and metaphysical situations convincing me not to do them (side note, does it strike you as weird that the head of OpenAI, Sam Altman, was fired a week after I was for some secret AGI thing called Q* in my specialized area of study that has been making sensationalized headlines?). Ah it’s also made more credible by synchronicities in abundance, none more extreme than the ones around Tayler

Credible is the wrong word. It’s not made more credible. Just more corroborated when context fully understood and known

> This wasn't sent, but it's a good summary.

I’ve seen so many coincidental patterns in the universe that defy any standard physics explanation, that for a long time I really believed, pretty darn lucidly, that the universe had built into it an intelligence, that is, a God, or a mechanism for planning via singularizing intelligence across distributed intelligences

seeing many anomalies like this and having revelatory hypnogogic states that gave me insights into how those threaded divergences might mechanically be explained, made me think I was possibly fated for something, but I didn’t believe it and definitely don’t now

I saw many “coincidences” extreme ones, that I can list them at this point and you would agree “yeah that’s pretty coincidental” as in, with the sense of some absurdity to think them as not being paranormalities. Nothing I told you about so far

However, of all the paranormal-like coincidences, one of perhaps a few that didn’t traumatize me and didn’t fall apart were when, and describing this with a handful of mood uplift and a huge dose of innocence: [[paragraph-long story redacted]]. So like that — miraculous even. Hard to not interpret as a paranormal luck

However, since then, a lot of coincidences like that occurred and statistical anomalies that wove a thread over many years. And, unlike that example, resulted in extreme injustice in my life over the last 6 years

Those interventions were so extreme and directly caused physical, mental, lifelong damage. Since those interventions of the last 6 years had narrative cohesion behind them it can be inferred that there’s an intelligence behind them (or collective/distributed intelligences). Besides narrative structure: non-local reasoning across people who never met across thousands of miles, longish-term memory across many years, and many symbolic semantics

What makes it suspicious is that these paranormal circumstances weren’t miraculous but rather led to tragic outcomes after tragic outcomes, distracting me from things that provably would’ve benefited me, and with paper trails by the way indicting power-reasons to motivate such interventions (e.g. my successfully-executed ChatGPT-esque paper 5 years ago that I finished running the experiments for barely conscious in the hospital just before being brain damaged and abandoned by my first PhD advisor and left in the hands of my second PhD advisor who likewise abandoned me just when I had something potentially impactful to show for my time). Big statistical anomalies combined with a breadcrumb trail of tragedies around those near-achievements (including many others not mentioned) suggest a more conspiratorial interpretation over a more optimistic one

So why do I mention this? Is it to brag or lie about near-achievements? No. It’s because I’m describing a schizophrenic worldview

And unfortunately a justified, well-evidenced one

ergo, my life is destroyed. I’m scared. And I logically have to have the opposite of faith in the very things that govern everything and all of us including mind and consciousness 

## Another summary

I don’t know why these things happen. My best guess is some combination of shaping to other peoples’ judgements and meeting expectations. Perhaps the reason being some sort of authoritative hierarchy that’s enforced either culturally or between individuals, through communication patterns, potentially unconscious ones, potentially even language crypticism. These consciousness observations combined with observations of precognition and telepathy on enough occasions and convincing occasions suggested to me the interference is more than local. And with the many past outcomes of severe loss tragedy and suffering, convinced me that the overall intelligence of the system is low and probably by my personal principles evil. However this larger collective process works, it is far from “good” let alone “God” from what I can tell. Most likely given the [extreme] evidence of such instances I have and extreme evidence of those threadings having long-term harm in severe ways, my current general “ruling” about these suspicious mental viscera and the corresponding divergences from statistical precedent and my own personal background and past near-achievements, and the extreme suffering I’ve been through at odds with the extremely extreme discipline I exercised through great sacrifice and patience, is that the collective consciousness is evil, there is no worship-worthy God, and no divine natural force measurably stands up to optimistic interpretation, compared to, perhaps more conspiratorial (e.g. a corrupt centralized decentrality of greedy actors and power-preserving special interests in the ethereum unethically inducing cause and effect in the real world, sometimes targeted against individuals, for the same motivated reasons that humans have). I think whatever exists probably is humans at some level.

> Also good self-quote from that line, and the main reason I'm including this:

Ha, I don’t have much to add to that. That about sums it up. I guess how would you define basic necessity? Food and water of course. What about relationships? I think when people think of basic rights, they think food, housing, healthcare, education… I kinda think human relationships are the highest point and purpose of life, more so than food or water or shelter or any human construction. Not to get political, especially on the very good point of dis-identifying from symbolic attachments/ideas, but Marx regarded alienation as one of the big problems facing workers. Alienation from oneself but also from others. I kind of agree, though of course presuming those basic necessities of food and comfort are also met

idk, my big dissatisfaction in the world is it really seems like I’m alone all the time. So when pondering about any sort of utopia, I can’t discount the very real torment that comes from technically having all those things (basic necessities) but not the relationships and real-world relationship dynamics that really merit living
